# About
PicoMine is an unfinished 2D sandbox game inspired by
[Minicraft](https://github.com/Miserlou/Minicraft).

The game has several design goals:
* Procedurally-generated top-down tile-based 2D worlds.
* Progression to an ending through various mechanics and tiers of items.
* World saving and loading.

The game is in an early stage of development and is not yet playable.

# Dependencies
PicoMine uses the following libraries:
* [minifb](https://crates.io/crates/minifb) - Window management, input, and
framebuffer rendering.
